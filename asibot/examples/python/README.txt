A small HOW-TO
--------------
For examples, first install yarp linking with YARPMODS (see yarpmods/exportable/README.txt).
Compile YARP with the desired YARPMODS devices. Compile yarp2/examples/swig activating the
PYTHON option. test_yarpmods.py should serve as a guideline to use these devices through Python.

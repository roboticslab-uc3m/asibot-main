The YARP/Simulink examples have been developed by Juan G. Victores
(http://roboticslab.uc3m.es/roboticslab/persona.php?id_pers=72), licenced as the rest of
the ASIBOT Open Source Repository (http://roboticslab.sourceforge.net/asibot) from where this
source can be downloaded.

Install
-------
Run the following command in MATLAB for the examples to work:
mex sfun_time.c

You also need to have YARP integrated into MATLAB. Make sure you can execute the following from MATLAB:

## Install CMake (Ubuntu 14.10)

We use CMake for project generating. Installing CMake on Ubuntu is quite straightforward. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using '''sudo'''. Type:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui  # Recommended, as it contains ccmake.
```

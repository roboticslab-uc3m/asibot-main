\section Installation

The application is installed when you install the applications, which for Ubuntu is done by:
\verbatim
make install_applications  # In-project install: No super-user permissions are required.
\endverbatim

Adapt $ASIBOT_ROOT/share/colorDepth/scripts/colorDepthSim.xml.template to your needs or just:
\verbatim
cd $ASIBOT_ROOT/share/colorDepth/scripts
cp colorDepthSim.xml.template colorDepthSim.xml
\endverbatim

You will also need the \ref cartesianServer module and \ref colorDepth module. For further installation
steps refer to <a class="el" href="pages.html">your own system installation guidelines</a>.

\section running_colorDepth_App Running (assuming correct installation)

First we must run a YARP name server if it is not running in our current namespace:
\verbatim
[on terminal 1] yarp server
\endverbatim

Browse to $ASIBOT_ROOT/share and run yarpmanager (formerly gyarpmanager). The colorDepthSim App should be available.
\verbatim
[on terminal 2] cd $ASIBOT_ROOT/share
[on terminal 2] yarpmanager
\endverbatim
